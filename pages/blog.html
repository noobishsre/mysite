                        As of today, I've been a SRE for one month now. I'd like to start by saying that this first post 
                        and probably the next few, will not be very technically oriented. While I've published a little bit 
                        of code to the prod environment, the majority of my time these first four weeks has been spent learning 
                        the architecture of our infrastructure inch by inch. It's been a humbling experience to an extent. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When I realized just how big my environment spans, I also realized that this would not be a quick or easy excursion.
                        However, after a few weeks of research and whiteboard sessions, I finally had a good handle on our architecture. 
                        The next struggle was learning what a Site Reliability Engineer actually does. Not only that, but what the workflow should be, 
                        what should I be working on, what are the priority levels. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        To quote the great movie 'Office Space': "What would you say, you do here?".
                        Admittedly, I'm still figuring this part at this point but I have a much better understanding of it then 
                        I did when I started. I've come to learn that a SRE encompasses quite a bit more then just automating tasks. 
                        We handle incidents, bridge calls on high priority issues, report analysis, network analysis, the list goes 
                        on. In fact, today I published my first KB article to the Knowledge base used by our level 1 and 2 troubleshooting 
                        teams. It was an interesting experience writing a KB from the perspective of someone who would not be using it. 
                        No matter though, I received a "Nice Work" shout out from my manager before he forwarded it off to a few other managers, 
                        so I must have done something right. In my next post, I'll try to discuss something a little more technical. 
                        Thank you to anyone who views this and I hope you enjoyed.

                <span>In light of recent events that occurred during my most recent sprint, I'm going to break my post into two parts. The first will be a wonderful and meaningful story of an aspiring SRE and his triumph over his the industry and part 2 will be my first couple sprints. In case you haven't guessed already, the last part of my first statement might not have been entirely accurate and here's why. Yesterday I committed my code for this weeks sprint and in doing so, managed to kick off a chain of events which eventually went on to completely brick our whole Module.</span>

                <span>Hello Again folks! I'm really excited for this post as it is my first time sharing a script via a blog. To preface, I'm clueless about the preferred method of sharing a script via a blog post nor do I really even how to format it for that matter. Additionally, being that this wonderful blog host doesn't allow much with formatting, I decided to use screenshots of the actual code and included a link for the script on pastebin at the bottom. I know, that's what I get for being cheap and choosing the free version. As always, I'm open to any suggestions or feedback. That in mind, lets get into this!</span>

                <span>Hello again! To start off today, I'd first like to apologize to any actual followers I might have for the delay since my last post. In addition to still getting used to blogging, as we all, the world can get pretty chaotic and busy. Luckily,  things have finally settled down and now I can get back into this thing. I've been looking forward to this post for some time now. With having the chance to break in my new Dev Environment during my last post, I'm excited to put it to good use. My plan for this approach is to start with pipeline Basics (Overview, basic usae) followed by some more advanced concepts and concluding with a script related to the commands used in the examples.</span>

                <span>OK.... I have a confession to make. Despite my intentions, it appears that I have not been entirely truthful with you. I know that I had planned to discuss and demonstrate Github usage for this post but I just can't do it. I think it's time that I take this blog and "change course" and start diving into some real topics and concepts. When I say "real", I'm referring to the core reason and motivation behind me even starting this blog, being an SRE. Also, let's be honest, if you want to learn how to use github, go to github.com. In addition to their site having plenty of documentation, said documentation is very thorough and easy to follow. Also, there's a high percentage chance that github is a more reliable source then myself.</span>
