                        To say that Information Technology is a passion of mine, would be an understatement. Over the course 
                        of my almost 6 years in the industry, I’ve rarely done anything that I would consider “work”. This is 
                        because I love everything about my profession and industry. Just as any other job, there have been annoyances 
                        along the way. However, when your career basically revolves around playing with toys, refining them and 
                        improving them, or even building new toys altogether, it’s pretty rare to find me not in a good mood.
                        <br>
                        I’ve been told that one of the tells for how good of a mood I’m in is how fast I’m talking. This is a 
                        result of another “fun fact” about me. I have ADHD. This is a subject I plan on expanding on in my 
                        About Me page but the short version is that the H stands for hyperactive and it’s referring to my brain’s 
                        “natural state”… or at least half of it. Regardless, the end result is a self-taught Site Reliability Engineer 
                        who works for one of the largest retail chains in the US. My objectives are simple; learning, growth, helping others, and innovation.

                        <h5>Career Overview</h5>
                        I’ve been in the IT industry since May of 2012 when I landed a position as a Technical Support Rep. After 
                        a year and a half, my career path pivoted and I spent the next four years in the infrastructure side of the 
                        IT world. The first two years, I spent in the desktop support world and the second two were as a Systems Administrator.
                        <br>
                        Currently, I’m a Site Reliability Engineer at Target Corporation based out of the Twin Cities area and have been for 
                        a little over a year now. 
                        <br>
                        Here’s a breakdown of my experience in the IT industry.
                        <ul>    
                            <li>Web Technical Support – 1.5 Years</li>
                            <li>Enterprise Desktop Support – 1 Year</li>
                            <li>Systems Administrator – 2.5 Years</li>
                            <li>Site Reliability Engineer – 2 Years</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My future career aspirations could more or less be summed up with the phrase, “I want to learn and I want to grow” but 
                        that really doesn't paint much of a picture though, does it? That said, although a fairly obvious statement, it is accurate. 
                        If there is one thing that I have really taken to heart throughout my career, it's the realization of just how lucky I am 
                        that I ended up in a field that I enjoy.
                        <br>
                        It's with this mindset that I started thinking about what I want to do in a more long term sense. The reality is that 
                        there are a wide variety of different areas of the IT world that I would love working in but only a few that are truly 
                        in the sweet spot. To give a little context into what I mean when I say sweet spot, consider a programmer who enjoys 
                        writing code. This role can exist in all kinds of different flavors and stacks from network and infrastructure to applications and APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For me, the sweet spot has been influenced heavily by time as a Systems Administrator as well as my time so far as a 
                        reliability engineer. What I enjoyed most about being a SysAdmin was getting to work with all areas of the stack from 
                        server administration to network administration to software patching and rollouts. In fact, funny side note, all of the 
                        responsibilities I had while being a SysAdmin ended up becoming the biggest drivers for me learning how to automate. Trying 
                        to manage all of those responsibilities across 3 offices, while supporting 500 end users with only one other person was a 
                        no win scenario. We were constantly treading water and since I already had a fair amount of programming knowledge, 
                        I dove in and never looked back, sort of.
                        <br>
                        If there's one thing I've missed in my role as an SRE, it's been working with an infra stack. Everything from the types of 
                        problems encountered to the beauty of seeing all of the pieces work together in tandem to enable countless others to do their 
                        jobs. Even better is when your work improves the quality of theirs as a result of stable technology doing what it's supposed 
                        to without causing problems for the end-user. That's when it hit me. How awesome would it be to be someone who designs and 
                        architects an infrastructure stack? I'm not sure what the timetable would look like, maybe 5 years, maybe 10 but regardless, 
                        I'm looking forward to learning the answer out for myself.
